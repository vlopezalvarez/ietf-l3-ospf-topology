--- abstract

This document defines a YANG data model for representing an abstract view of the provider network topology that contains Open Source Path First (OSPF)  information. This document augments the 'ietf-network' data model by adding OSPF concepts. 

The YANG data model defined in this document conforms to the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA).

# Introduction

Topology collection is a critical use case for the network operators because the network topology is an abstract representation of the physical nodes, links and network interconnections. 

Exchanging OSPF information between a service orchestration layer and a SDN controller to create services is desirable. The deployment of L3 services with the Layer 3 VPN Network Model (L3NM) {{!RFC9182}} is more accurate if the SDN controller can export OSPF topological information, so the customer uses the information of the controller instead of getting it from inventory information. 

The main idea of this model is to represent most relevant OSPF topology attributes.

This document defines a YANG data model for representing, managing and controlling the OSPF topology. The data model augments ietf-network module {{!RFC8345}} by adding the OSPF information.

This document explains the scope and purpose of the OSPF topology model and how the topology and service models fit together.

The YANG data model defined in this document conforms to the Network Management Datastore Architecture {{!RFC8342}}.

## Terminology and Notations 

This document assumes that the reader is familiar with the contents of {{!RFC8345}}, . The document uses terms from those documents.

The terminology for describing YANG data models is found in {{!RFC7950}}, {{!RFC8795}} and {{!RFC8346}}.

Following terms are used for the representation of this data model.

TBD

## Requirements Language

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in  {{!RFC2119}}, {{!RFC8174}} when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

## Tree Diagram

Authors include a simplified graphical representation of the data model is used in {{ietf-l3-ospf-topology-tree}} of this document.
The meaning of the symbols in these diagrams is defined in {{!RFC8340}}.

## Prefix in Data Node Names

  In this document, names of data nodes and other data model objects are prefixed using the standard prefix associated with the corresponding YANG imported modules, as shown in the following table.

| Prefix | Yang Module            | Reference    |
| ------ | ---------------------- | ------------ |
| ospfnt | ietf-l3-ospf-topology  | RFCXXX       |
| yang   | ietf-yang-types        | {{!RFC6991}} |

Please replace XXXX with the RFC number assigned to this document.
Please remove this note.

# YANG Data Model for OSPF Topology

## YANG Model Overview

The abstract (base) network data model is defined in the "ietf-network" module of {{!RFC8345}}. The OSPF-topology builds on the network data model defined in the "ietf-network" module {{!RFC8345}}, augmenting the nodes with ospf information, which anchor the links and are contained in nodes).

The set of parameters and augmentations are included just a node level. Each parameter and description are detailed following:

* Network-types: Its presence identifies the OSPF topology type. Thus, the network type MUST be ospf-topology.
+ OSPF timer attributes: Identifies the node timer attributes configured in the Network-Element. They are SPF wait and the LSP generate.
- OSPF status: contains the neighbours information.

The set of parameters and augmentations are included just a termination point level. Each parameter is listed as follows:

* Interface-type
+ Area ID
+ Metric
- Passive mode

# Security Considerations

    The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for
    data that is designed to be accessed via network management
    protocols such as NETCONF {{!RFC6241}} or RESTCONF 
    {{!RFC8040}}.  The lowest NETCONF layer is the secure transport
    layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is Secure
    Shell (SSH) {{!RFC6242}}. The lowest RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and
    the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS {{!RFC5246}}.

   The NETCONF access control model {{!RFC6536}} provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a    preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config) to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.

# IANA Considerations

  This document registers the following namespace URIs in the IETF XML registry {{!RFC3688}}:

    --------------------------------------------------------------------
    URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-l3-ospf-topology
    Registrant Contact: The IESG.
    XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.
    --------------------------------------------------------------------

   This document registers the following YANG module in the YANG Module Names registry {{!RFC6020}}:

    --------------------------------------------------------------------
    name:         ietf-l3-ospf-topology
    namespace:    urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-l3-ospf-topology

# Implementation Status

This section will be used to track the status of the implementations of the model. It is aimed at being removed if the document becomes RFC.
